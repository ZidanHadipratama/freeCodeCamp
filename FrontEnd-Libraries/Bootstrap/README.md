## Introduction to Bootstrap 🌟

Bootstrap is a CSS framework that offers a collection of pre-designed styles, components, and layouts, making it easier to create consistent and responsive web designs. It simplifies the process of building modern and attractive websites while ensuring they look great on various devices and screen sizes.

## Getting Started 🏁

To begin using Bootstrap, you'll need to include its CSS and JavaScript files in your HTML document. You can either download the files or use content delivery networks (CDNs) for quicker integration. Here's how you can get started:

```html
<!-- Include Bootstrap CSS -->
<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://maxcdn.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/4.5.2/css/bootstrap.min.css">

<!-- Include Bootstrap JS and jQuery -->
<script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/3.5.1/jquery.min.js"></script>
<script src="https://maxcdn.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/4.5.2/js/bootstrap.min.js"></script>
```

## Responsive Images 📷

To ensure your images adapt to different screen sizes, use the `.img-responsive` class:

```html
<img src="your-image.jpg" alt="Responsive Image" class="img-responsive">
```

## Centering Text 🎯

Center align text using the `.text-center` class:

```html
<div class="text-center">
  <p>This text is centered.</p>
</div>
```

## Buttons 📝

Create buttons with the `.btn` and `.btn-default` classes:

```html
<button class="btn btn-default">Click Me</button>
```

## Button Colors 🎨

Change button colors using different classes:

```html
<button class="btn btn-primary">Primary Button</button>
<button class="btn btn-info">Info Button</button>
<button class="btn btn-danger">Danger Button</button>
```

## Grid System 📊

Bootstrap's grid system helps create responsive layouts. Use `.row` for rows and `.col-md-*` for columns:

```html
<div class="container">
  <div class="row">
    <div class="col-md-6">Column 1</div>
    <div class="col-md-6">Column 2</div>
  </div>
</div>
```

## Adding Depth with Wells 🌅

Add visual depth to elements using the `.well` class:

```html
<div class="well">
  This is a well with some content.
</div>
```

## Form Controls 📝

Use the `.form-control` class to create input fields that take up 100% width:

```html
<input type="text" class="form-control" placeholder="Enter your text">
```
