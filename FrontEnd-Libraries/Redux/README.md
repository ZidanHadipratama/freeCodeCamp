## Introduction

Redux is designed to manage the state of your application in a predictable and organized manner. It enforces a strict unidirectional data flow, making it easier to understand and manage the flow of data within your app.

## Single Source of Truth

In Redux, there exists a single state object that represents the entire state of your application. This stands in contrast to scenarios where each component has its own local state. With Redux, the state of your entire app is defined and managed by a single state object stored within the Redux store. This fundamental principle ensures that the Redux store serves as the authoritative source of truth for your application's state.

## Redux Store

The Redux store is the container for your application's state. To create a Redux store, you use the `createStore()` method provided by the Redux library. This method requires a reducer function, which is responsible for handling state transitions.

Here's an example of creating a Redux store:

```javascript
const reducer = (state = 5) => {
  return state;
}

const store = Redux.createStore(reducer);
```

## Getting Current State

You can access the current state held within the Redux store using the `getState()` method. This method provides a snapshot of your application's state at any given point.

```javascript
const store = Redux.createStore(
  (state = 5) => state
);

const currentState = store.getState();
```

## Dispatching Actions

In Redux, state updates are initiated by dispatching actions. An action is a plain JavaScript object that describes an event that occurred in your application. The Redux store receives these actions and updates its state accordingly. Actions must include a `type` property to indicate the type of action being performed.

Actions serve as messengers, conveying information about events to the Redux store. The store processes these actions to perform state updates.

## Action Creators

To streamline the process of creating and dispatching actions, you can define action creators. An action creator is a function that returns an action object. This abstraction simplifies the creation of action objects and promotes code reusability.

Here's an example of an action creator:

```javascript
const action = {
  type: 'LOGIN'
}

// Define an action creator here:
function actionCreator(type) {
  return {
    type: type
  };
}
```

By using Redux, you can maintain a clear and centralized state management approach in your applications, ensuring better predictability and maintainability of your codebase.
