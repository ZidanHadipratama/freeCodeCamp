# Redux Basics üöÄ

## Introduction to Redux üåü

Redux is a state management framework that can be integrated with various web technologies, including React.

In Redux, your application's entire state is managed by a single state object within the Redux store. Unlike local component states in React, Redux enforces a single source of truth for your application's state. This means that even in a complex React app with multiple components, all state is contained within the Redux store.

## Getting Started üõ†Ô∏è

To create a Redux store, follow these steps:

1. Define a reducer function that specifies how the state should be updated in response to actions.

```javascript
const reducer = (state = initialState, action) => {
  // Update state based on action type
  return newState;
};
```

2. Create a Redux store by passing the reducer function to `Redux.createStore()`.

```javascript
const store = Redux.createStore(reducer);
```

## Retrieving State from the Store üìú

You can get the current state of the Redux store using the `getState()` method.

```javascript
const currentState = store.getState();
```

## Working with Actions üéØ

In Redux, actions are dispatched to trigger state updates. An action is a plain JavaScript object with a `type` property indicating the type of action being performed.

```javascript
const action = {
  type: 'LOGIN'
};
```

## Action Creators üåà

Action creators are functions that return action objects. They simplify the process of creating actions.

```javascript
const actionCreator = () => {
  return {
    type: 'LOGIN'
  };
};
```

## Dispatching Actions üöÄ

To update the state, you dispatch actions to the Redux store using the `dispatch()` method.

```javascript
store.dispatch(actionCreator());
```

## Handling Actions with Reducers üîÑ

Reducers are pure functions that handle state changes based on dispatched actions. They take the current state and an action as parameters and return a new state.

```javascript
const reducer = (state = initialState, action) => {
  switch (action.type) {
    case 'LOGIN':
      return { ...state, loggedIn: true };
    default:
      return state;
  }
};
```

## Combining Reducers üîó

As your app grows, you might have multiple reducers to manage different parts of the state. Combine them using `Redux.combineReducers()`.

```javascript
const rootReducer = Redux.combineReducers({
  user: userReducer,
  todos: todosReducer
});
```

## Middleware for Asynchronous Actions ‚è≥

For handling asynchronous actions, you can use Redux Thunk middleware. It allows action creators to return functions, enabling asynchronous operations.

```javascript
const asyncAction = () => {
  return function(dispatch) {
    dispatch(requestData());
    fetchData().then(data => {
      dispatch(receiveData(data));
    });
  };
};
```

## Immutable State ‚ùÑÔ∏è

Redux enforces immutable state. To update an object or array in a state, create a new copy using spread syntax or methods like `Object.assign()`.

```javascript
const newState = { ...state, property: newValue };
```

## Example: Counter App üî¢

```javascript
const INCREMENT = 'INCREMENT';
const DECREMENT = 'DECREMENT';

const counterReducer = (state = 0, action) => {
  switch (action.type) {
    case INCREMENT:
      return state + 1;
    case DECREMENT:
      return state - 1;
    default:
      return state;
  }
};

const store = Redux.createStore(counterReducer);

store.dispatch({ type: INCREMENT });
console.log(store.getState()); // Output: 1

store.dispatch({ type: DECREMENT });
console.log(store.getState()); // Output: 0
```

## Example: Removing Items from an Array ‚ûñ

```javascript
const immutableReducer = (state = [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5], action) => {
  switch (action.type) {
    case 'REMOVE_ITEM':
      return state.slice(0, action.index).concat(state.slice(action.index + 1));
    default:
      return state;
  }
};

const removeItem = (index) => {
  return {
    type: 'REMOVE_ITEM',
    index
  };
};

const store = Redux.createStore(immutableReducer);

store.dispatch(removeItem(4));
console.log(store.getState()); // Output: [0, 1, 2, 3, 5]
```

## Example: Copying an Object with `Object.assign` üìã

```javascript
const defaultState = {
  user: 'CamperBot',
  status: 'offline'
};

const immutableReducer = (state = defaultState, action) => {
  switch (action.type) {
    case 'ONLINE':
      return Object.assign({}, state, { status: 'online' });
    default:
      return state;
  }
};

const wakeUp = () => {
  return {
    type: 'ONLINE'
  };
};

const store = Redux.createStore(immutableReducer);

store.dispatch(wakeUp());
console.log(store.getState()); // Output: { user: 'CamperBot', status: 'online' }
```

## Conclusion üèÅ

Redux is a powerful state management library that helps you manage and organize your application's state in a predictable way. By following the principles of immutability and unidirectional data flow, you can build more maintainable and scalable applications. Happy coding! ‚ú®
