## Problem‚ùì:

A prime number is a whole number greater than 1 with exactly two divisors: 1 and itself. For example, 2 is a prime number because it is only divisible by 1 and 2. In contrast, 4 is not prime since it is divisible by 1, 2 and 4.

Rewrite sumPrimes so it returns the sum of all prime numbers that are less than or equal to num.



## My Solutionüí°:

The way I solve it is like this:
1. Check the number start from 2 until the argument is it a prime or not.
2. If it is prime, sum it.

So I came up with this:
```javascript
function sumPrimes(num) {
  let sum = 0;
  for (let i=2;i<=num;i++){
    let prime = true
    for (let a=2;a<i;a++){
      if (i%a == 0){
        prime = false;
        break
      }
    }
    if (!prime){
      continue
    }else{
      sum += i;
    }
  }
  return sum;
}
```
The first `for` loops is to iterate number from 2 until before `num`. The second `for` loops is to check if the number is prime or not.

There is a better algorithm for this. It's called Sieve of Eratosthenes. But my one cell brain cannot comprehend it üò¢üò¢üò¢.

Here are some of the example usage:

```javascript
console.log(sumPrimes(10)); //Output 17
console.log(sumPrimes(977));//Output 73156
```
